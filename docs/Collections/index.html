<p>FEMA publication 191</p>

<p>This was an annual report to the Senate Appropriations committee that FEMA submitted for three years.  The 1992 edition is the last, and it can be found elsewhere on the Internet (this one is from NIST, https://nehrpsearch.nist.gov/static/files/FEMA/PB94147212.pdf, with a cleaned up front cover).  The 1991 version is a not so great scan (with crude cleanup of page images in MS Paint) that I made myself at the NETC Library in Emmitsburg in 2017, but it has really nice line maps in the back (which did scan well).  The 1990 edition scanned well, but the maps are poor quality (they're greyscale renditions of color maps printed in FEMA-196 - the 1991 versions are redrawn as line drawings and they are very good).</p>
